Our Services may use modern approaches and settings including machine learning or artificial intelligence algorithms to provide you with personalized solutions that meet the needs of your creativity. While using face effects we need to show them in the right place in your photos to realize the final result of how the tool works. This information is not used to identify you.



                        Our Services explicitly do not utilize facial recognition, biometric templates, or any other systems regulated by law. These functionalities are not permitted within the scope of our application. We stick to strict compliance with applicable regulations, ensuring that no activities involving facial information (hereinafter referred to as "Face Data") or the creation and storage of biometric templates take place. Our focus is on maintaining compliance and upholding user privacy within the authorized and permissible parameters of the app.
                        
                        
                        
                        When you use our application, we may collect information about you, including photographs you provide when you use the application, via your camera or camera roll. This may include capturing and storing images or videos containing Face Data. We obtain only the specific images you chose to modify using the application; we do not collect your photo albums even if you grant us access to them.
                        
                        
                        
                        The data we gather as part of our services does not encompass biometric information, as photographs are expressly excluded from the category of data classified as biometric identifiers. However, we acknowledge that photographs, especially those containing Face Data, merit the same or an even more protective level of care as we apply to the storage, transmission, and protection of other confidential and sensitive information.
                        
                        
                        
                        In compliance with the law, we are committed that:
                        
                        
                        
                        The Face Data is solely used for the purpose of providing specific features and functionalities within the application. Thus, we may store Face Data for general technical purposes without involving automated or systematic processing for unique identification aims. We refrain from extracting Face Data, as well as from extracting or storing face geometry, including Biometric identifiers.
                        
                        
                        
                        We herein obtain your explicit consent before collecting and processing any personal data including photographs containing Face Data. You have the right to control and manage the face data shared with our application. We will seek additional consent if we intend to use your information for any other purpose not mentioned herein.
                        
                        
                        
                        We store photographs containing Face Data securely on our servers or locally on your device, ensuring appropriate technical and organizational measures are in place to protect it from unauthorized access or disclosure.
                        
                        
                        
                        Photographs containing Face Data will be retained for the duration necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected. We have established a retention and deletion schedule in accordance with applicable laws. Once the purpose has been fulfilled or your consent is withdrawn, we will take steps to securely delete and destroy your data.
                        
                        
                        
                        In the case of generating features using Artificial Intelligence, additional configurations based on deep learning and text-to-image mechanisms may be required. As a result, processing activities are carried out on our server.
                        
                        We implement industry-standard security measures to protect information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Our commitment to security includes encryption and access controls.
                        
                        
                        
                        We do not share or disclose your photographs containing Face Data to any third parties unless explicitly stated otherwise and with your prior consent. You have the right to request the deletion of your photographs containing Face Data at any time. 
                        
                        Please notice we do not use the photographs you provide when you use the application for any reason other than to provide you with the editing functionality of the application and the goals and purposes mentioned above. We do not sell, lease, trade, or otherwise profit from your biometric identifier or biometric information.</p>
